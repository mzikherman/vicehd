### VICEHD IS THE BEST WAY TO WATCH VICE VIDEOS ONLINE

We love Viceâ€™s video content, but we hate the way we have to watch it. The YouTube channel is ok. The website is ok. We wanted something better. [So we built something better (that quickly had to get taken down)](http://www.vicehd.com/).

### RUNNING IT LOCALLY
Assuming you have node and mongo installed
``` sh
git clone git@github.com:vrsity/vicehd.git && cd vicehd
npm install
scripts/update-all # scrapes content and builds database
npm start
```

### UNDER THE HOOD

- Inspiration: [Vice](http://vice.com), [VHX](http://www.vhx.tv/), [Shelby.tv](http://shelby.tv/)
- Built With: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)
- Design: [Eli Rousso](https://twitter.com/elirousso)
- Development: [Moudy Elkammash](https://twitter.com/moudy)

### TODO
- Use Ember data or something else to clean up `$.getJSON` calls
